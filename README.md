# Gene_Status_Classifier
The code in this repo can be used to classify tumour samples based on presence or absence of variations in a gene of interest. For this classification task, expression data will be used as the feature matrix and samples will be labeled as "Mutant" or "Wild-type" based on presence or absence of variation in a gene of interest.
