# Gene_Status_Classifier

## Overview
The code in this repo can be used to classify tumour samples based on presence or absence of variations in a gene of interest. For this classification task, expression data will be used as the feature matrix and samples will be labeled as "Mutant" or "Wild-type" based on presence or absence of variation in a gene of interest. The status of a gene is labeled based on SNV/INDEL (Single Nucleotide Variations/Small Insertions and Deletions), CNV (Copy Number Variations), and SV (Structural Variations) data.
