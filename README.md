# Cancer_Gene_Mutational_Status_Classifier

## Overview
This repository provides code for classifying tumour sample expression data based on the presence or absence of alterations in any gene of interest. In this classification task, the expression data serves as the feature matrix, and samples are labeled as either "Mutant" or "Wild-type" depending on whether the gene of interest carries any alterations. The status of a gene can be determined using a combination of SNV/INDEL (Single Nucleotide Variations/Small Insertions and Deletions), CNV (Copy Number Variations), and/or SV (Structural Variations) data.
